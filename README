saj

This is the next version of 'sosreport-analyzer-ng'.

# saj
Analyze sosreport in many different ways

This software installs 2 binary file, 'saj','cmp-saj'
which are linked with
libsaj-sar-analyzer.so and libsaj-sosreport-analyzer.so.
You can check linkage with like '$ ldd /usr/local/bin/saj'.

# versions

saj reads directories parallelly.
Your favorite will be always the latest version.
saj reads config file in user's home directory,
'~/.saj', edit file there.

# requirements

You need these packages.

autoconf
intltool
gcc-c++
libtool

How to build:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

 It will install 2 programs, 'saj', 'cmp-saj'
 in '/usr/local/bin'.

1. saj for analyze sosreport

Program Name: saj

Binary path: /usr/local/bin/saj

  Analyze sosreport in many different ways.

saj has two features.

1-1. saj for sosreport

Binary path: /usr/local/bin/saj

  For sosreport

  New version of config is found in /usr/share/saj/saj.conf.example.
  Copy it as ~/.saj/saj.conf.
  It may be easier to use GUI, and 'Restore configs'.

  These ones are to be analyzed with config settings.

  These ones are to be analyzed with automatically.

  - Is hostname set in '/etc/hosts'?
  - Are there any NIC which has no carrier? 
  - Are there any NIC which has unrecoverable errors? 
  - Any bonding has down NIC(s)? 
  - Is 'resolv.conf' empty? 
  - Is NIC offload is on? 


  For mcinfo 

  New version of config is found in /usr/share/saj/saj-mcinfo.conf.example.
  Copy it as ~/.saj/saj-mcinfo.conf.
  It may be easier to use GUI, and 'Restore configs'.

  Note that members in the same directory, upper ones will be analyzed and those are omitted for the rest. 

1-2. saj for sar

  Presently, it gives -ZM option to usual sar-analyzer functionality.

  There are seven features.

  Show highest and lowest average value to a file with a report.
  Show spike, highest and lowest value to a file with a report.
  Show spike, highest and lowest value in given time-span to a file with a report.
  Show possible thrashing.
  Show network down.
  am-pm style is converted to abs style in the report.
  Generate graphs as SVG files.

  When the file sanity check fails, program stops echoing the reason.
  In that case, move the very file to other than <sosreport-dir>/var/log/sa and run the program again. 
  Or you may reading file including Japanese although machine locale is not JP.
  In that case, edit libsar-analyzer/Makefile.am to use common_jp.c and sar_analyzer_jp.c.

## Getting "sar file"

  Note that "sar file" should be basically, written in English or Japanese.

  It may be good to convert binary 'sa' file to text 'sar' file.
  Because, sometimes, text 'sar' file is not made yet but binary 'sa' file exists.
  Here is a way converting 'sa' file to 'sar' file.

  example:
  $ LC_ALL=C sar -f /var/log/sa/sa01 -A -t > ./sar01

  or in Japanese environment, just do this.

  $ sar -f /var/log/sa/sa01 -A -t > ./sar01

  how to remove ^@

  Sometimes, ^@ will appear in 'sar' file. In those cases, remove with this command.

  example:
  $ sed -i 's/\x00//g' ./sar01

  When you did above, check 'sar' file is written in Ascii text and clear.

  example:
  $less sar01

3. cmp-saj

Program Name: cmp-saj

Binary path: /usr/local/bin/cmp-saj

  Compare 2 files emitted by saj.


## Before using

In case saj is executed by ordinary user not root, which is default, sosreport should be
owned by the very user.
Execute the command below so that all the files are owned by the user.

 # chown <user:user> <directory_of_sosreport> -R

  - sosreport

    Check ~/.saj/saj.conf

      By installation process, config file is not copied to your home directory.
      It will be copied when you first excecute the program or restore with GUI program.

      You can set analyzing word for each analyzing member.
      If you are not sure, consult /usr/share/saj/saj.conf.example.
      New version will not override the conf file. When you build new version, be sure to copy file
      or at least, copy lines needed.

      You can use GUI program to edit or restore config file.

  - mcinfo 

    Check ~/.saj/saj-mcinfo.conf

      By installation process, config file is not copied to your home directory.
      It will be copied when you first excecute the program or restore with GUI program.

      You can set analyzing word for each analyzing member.
      If you are not sure, consult /usr/share/saj/saj-mcinfo.conf.example.
      New version will not override the conf file. When you build new version, be sure to copy file
      or at least, copy lines needed.

      You can use GUI program to edit or restore config file.

  - utility script

    You may use utility script in 'utils'.

    Excecute 'unfold.sh' to unfold comperssed files in that directory.
    Excecute 'align_netstat.sh <path/to/var/net/netstat>' to see netstat each item value.

## Usage

  - sosreport

    $ saj -D <sosreport-dir>

      It writes a file to './saj/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_<time>.txt',
      './saj-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_analyze_<time>.txt'.
      './saj-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
      and, './saj-results/<sosreport-dir>/graphs/<sosreport-dir>-<item>-<no>.svg'.

  - mcinfo

    $ saj -M -D <mcinfo-dir>

      It writes a file to './saj-results/<mcinfo-dir>/<mcinfo-dir>_<time>.txt',
      './saj-results/<mcinfo-dir>/<mcinfo-dir>_analyze_<time>.txt'.
      './saj-results/<mcinfo-dir>/<mcinfo-dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
      and, './saj-results/<mcinfo-dir>/graphs/<mcinfo-dir>-<item>-<no>.svg'.

  - sar-only 

    $ saj -S -D <sa-dir-path>

      It writes a file to './saj-results/<dir>/<dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
      and, './saj-results/<dir>/graphs/<dir>-<item>-<no>.svg'.

  - time-span for sar 

    ex.

    $ saj -T 09:00-13:00 -D <sosreport-dir> 
    $ saj -T 09:00-13:00 -M -D <mcinfo-dir> 
    $ saj -T 09:00-13:00 -S -D <sa-dir-path> 

  You can't redirect to a file.

## Log file of this program for each execution. 

    It writes a file to './saj-results/<dir>/<dir>_log_<time>',
    Some files are skipped just because file size is 0 or, exceeds max file size, check the log, please.

## Is this program safe to execute?

  You can execute this program as an ordinary user not root.
  Config file is in your home directory named '.saj'.

  Creating directory unconditionally in the current directory for the analyzed files, with no harm.

  No memory leakage.

    Checked with 'valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes -s saj -D <sosreport-dir>'.

## Uninstall
